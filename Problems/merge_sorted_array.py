from typing import List

# You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.
# Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.
# The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. 
# To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. 
# nums2 has a length of n.
